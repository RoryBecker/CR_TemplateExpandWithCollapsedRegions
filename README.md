CR_CleanupFileAndNamespaces
===========================



This is the first release of 'CleanupFileAndNamespaces for CodeRush'

'CleanupFileAndNamespaces for CodeRush' provides a single action 'CleanupFileAndNamespaces'.

When triggered, this action will run the 'Optimize Namespace References' refactoring followed by the 'CleanupFile' action.

You will need to bind a shortcut to the '' action in order to use this plugin.
